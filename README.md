# Selenium-Automation

This Repository contains a list of scripts that use Selenium Automation. The details of the scripts are listed below:

Lexii - Use selenium to interact with Lexii AI so that prompts can be inputed via the terminal.

Lexii_TTS - allows user to use an audio recordings to input prompts and response is delivered via text-to-speech

A use case for Lexii_TTS for me is for Live FOMC Meetings - The script is able to transcribe audio from livestreams and lexii ai is able to interpret the transcript. The prompt i use is 'Interpret the following transcript and determine if this is bullish, bearish or neutral'. (followed by the live transcription). This leads me to my next goal which is to build a trading bot that trades off of live FOMC speeches using this approach.
